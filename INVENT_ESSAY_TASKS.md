1. Evaluate the temporal urgency of the photograph. Examine whether the image communicates a fleeting, transient moment that almost was not captured. Look for signs that the cat was in motion or mid-action — blur from movement, the explosive geometry of a mid-leap or mid-pounce body, a wide-eyed expression caught in the instant before it changed, or any posture so precarious that it could only have lasted a fraction of a second. A photograph where the viewer instinctively feels that one moment later this scene no longer existed should score high. A photograph where the cat is still, settled, and could have been captured at any point over a long window of time should score low. The question is not whether the image is sharp or blurry, but whether it carries the electric charge of a moment rescued from the edge of disappearing.

2. Evaluate the uncomposed framing of the photograph. Examine whether the composition reveals a photographer reacting instinctively to a moment rather than deliberately constructing an image. Look for signs of reactive shooting — the cat clipped at the edges of the frame, the subject off-center or in an unexpected region of the image, an awkward or unusual shooting angle, a slight tilt, or focus that landed imperfectly because there was no time to adjust. These imperfections are evidence of authenticity. By contrast, look for signs of deliberate composition — the cat placed along the rule of thirds, a carefully chosen shallow depth of field, a flattering angle selected for visual impact, or clean intentional edges. The more the framing feels designed, the lower the score. The more it feels like a grab shot fired without time to aim, the higher the score.

3. Evaluate the environmental authenticity of the photograph. Examine whether the setting and background reflect the unedited, lived-in texture of real everyday life rather than a curated or controlled scene. Look for the honest clutter of a home shared with a cat — rumpled blankets, visible household objects, harsh or uneven natural lighting, ordinary furniture, and the general imperfection of a space that has not been tidied for the camera. These details are signals that the photograph was pulled from the flow of an ordinary day. By contrast, look for signs of curation or staging — clean minimal backdrops, studio lighting, artfully arranged props, or backgrounds that have been deliberately composed to flatter the subject. The more the environment feels like a real place where life is actively being lived, the higher the score. The more it feels like a set designed for a photograph, the lower the score.
