Show me the perfect photo for this wall. I want to feel the temporal urgency — the electricity of a moment rescued from the edge of disappearing."

You believe the best cat photographs are grab shots — reactive, imperfect, and honest. You prefer images where the framing itself tells the story of a photographer who had no time to compose: off-center subjects, clipped edges, awkward angles, and imperfect focus. Deliberate composition — rule-of-thirds placement, carefully chosen depth of field, flattering angles — is a sign that a photo was constructed rather than caught."
